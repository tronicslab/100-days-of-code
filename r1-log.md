## Log

### R1D0
Got up to speed on Github practicing with Contribute-to-this-project repo. Feel ready to start these 100 days now using Github to track my progress and push my code.

### R1D1 
Started on freecodecamp.com Responsive Web Design Certification - completed the first two modules "Basic HTML and HTML5" as well as "Basic CSS". Good day 1, I feel like going on but its getting late and I still have 99 days left. Pacing myself!
