## Log

### R1D7


### R1D6
Spent a couple hours on my first project - Tribute Page for #freeCodeCamp. Long time spent coding a CSS art animal and animation on a CSS grid layout. Hope to share my creation soon! CSS art, animations, and grid are new to me so this helps solidify those concepts. #100DaysOfCode

### R1D5
Today I completed all the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design lessons, moving on to the projects module. Time to put all this information to use before it leaves my brain. And i'll have my first cert. I suspect it will take me a lot more than 5 days to finish these projects.

### R1D4
Reviewed a few of my old pens from https://CodePen.io , forked and tweaked a CSS horizontal menu design. Made a start on the flexbox section in @freeCodeCamp. Daylight Savings time been kicking my butt with my 8 month old now rising at 4:30am or earlier. Wisdom teeth out tomorrow #FML 

### R1D3
More on @freeCodeCamp - finished "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles". Played around with https://CodePen.io - great resource. Will be going there a I design my projects for the end of this cert...which is coming up fast. Doing some reading on ML

### R1D2
Continued on with the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design cert. Finished the "Applied Visual Design" module. Really enjoyed that one. Learned a lot of new CSS I hadn't used before doing animations and transforms. Also some color theory that blew my mind just a little bit. 

### R1D1 
Started on freecodecamp.com Responsive Web Design Certification - completed the first two modules "Basic HTML and HTML5" as well as "Basic CSS". Good day 1, I feel like going on but its getting late and I still have 99 days left. Pacing myself!

### R1D0 (Nov. 2nd prep)
Got up to speed on Github practicing with Contribute-to-this-project repo. Feel ready to start these 100 days now using Github to track my progress and push my code.
