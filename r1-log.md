The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on November 3rd, Saturday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D18
Officially compete project 3 - Product landing page. Spent a good amount of time on this one, but i'm pretty happy with the result.

### R1D17
Learned how to do video embeds with <video> tag and the <iframe> method. Also figured out how to make an iframe embed responsive, which was not trivial.

### R1D16
More work on project 3. Added a live update module to allow seeing changes automatically in my browser. This workflow is working really well. Got the main layout of my product landing page done, just need to add meaningful content and style it better. 

### R1D15
More work on project 3. Switched from Codepen.io to using Sublime Text 3 and WAMP for building these projects so I can then push them to Github for storage. I really like Sublime. I just wish live updates were a thing while coding. 

### R1D14
Finished my second project - Survey Form - and made a start on my next project - Product Landing Page. Two full weeks in now. Enjoying this every day coding habit.

### R1D13
Just about finished my Survey form - got bored with the content so livened it up a bit with some sillyness.

### R1D12
Starting to really get the hang of CSS grid, working on completing the style and design nitpicky-ness before calling second project complete.

### R1D11
Made more headway on second project - Survey form. Decided to go with another CSS grid layout to further solidify the concept. Lots of trial and error so far.

### R1D10
Starting second project from Responsive Web Design - Survey form

### R1D9
Completed V2 of my Tribute page. Changed my approach and was about to remove about 25-30 lines of CSS. Works better now. And i'm happier with it now to move on.

### R1D8
Not a lot done today, family sick and pain from wisdom teeth pulled killed progress. Read up on JS and found some Front-End related Podcasts. Decidedd to rework my tribute page project.

### R1D7
Finished my first project - Tribute Page for #freeCodeCamp. Halfway through I realized it was going to be hard adding the media queries based on how I had laid everything out but I powered through and got a half-assed responsive tribute page. Not my best work. #100DaysOfCode

### R1D6
Spent a couple hours on my first project - Tribute Page for #freeCodeCamp. Long time spent coding a CSS art animal and animation on a CSS grid layout. Hope to share my creation soon! CSS art, animations, and grid are new to me so this helps solidify those concepts. #100DaysOfCode

### R1D5
Today I completed all the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design lessons, moving on to the projects module. Time to put all this information to use before it leaves my brain. And i'll have my first cert. I suspect it will take me a lot more than 5 days to finish these projects.

### R1D4
Reviewed a few of my old pens from https://CodePen.io , forked and tweaked a CSS horizontal menu design. Made a start on the flexbox section in @freeCodeCamp. Daylight Savings time been kicking my butt with my 8 month old now rising at 4:30am or earlier. Wisdom teeth out tomorrow #FML 

### R1D3
More on @freeCodeCamp - finished "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles". Played around with https://CodePen.io - great resource. Will be going there a I design my projects for the end of this cert...which is coming up fast. Doing some reading on ML

### R1D2
Continued on with the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design cert. Finished the "Applied Visual Design" module. Really enjoyed that one. Learned a lot of new CSS I hadn't used before doing animations and transforms. Also some color theory that blew my mind just a little bit. 

### R1D1 
Started on freecodecamp.com Responsive Web Design Certification - completed the first two modules "Basic HTML and HTML5" as well as "Basic CSS". Good day 1, I feel like going on but its getting late and I still have 99 days left. Pacing myself!

### R1D0 (Nov. 2nd prep)
Got up to speed on Github practicing with Contribute-to-this-project repo. Feel ready to start these 100 days now using Github to track my progress and push my code.
